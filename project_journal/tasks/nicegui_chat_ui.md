- Features:
  - Chat display area showing conversation history.
  - User input box and send button.
  - On sending, user message is appended.
  - AI response is currently a placeholder ("Hello, I am your AI assistant.").
- Ready for integration with real AI backend.

# Task Log: nicegui_chat_ui - Bug Fix: Chat output format

**Goal:** Investigate and fix the bug where the AI chat response is displayed as JSON instead of a natural language message.

---

**Investigation Findings:**

- The UI streams the backend `/chat` response chunk by chunk and appends it directly.
- The backend `/chat` endpoint streams message chunks generated by `query_response_with_streaming()`.
- This function uses `_process_message_chunk()` to extract plain text from nested JSON.
- Despite this, the UI still displayed JSON like `{ "joke": "..." }`.
- The root cause was found in `mcp_client/base.py`, where the system prompt explicitly instructed the AI to output JSON only.

---

**Fix Implemented:**

- Removed the JSON-enforcing instruction from the system prompt in `mcp_client/base.py`.
- This allowed the AI to respond in plain text.
- Also enhanced `_process_message_chunk()` to better extract plain text, but the key fix was prompt modification.

---

**Verification Result:**

- The backend server was restarted.
- The chat was tested with "Tell me a joke".
- The AI response is now plain text, e.g.:

```
Why did the scarecrow win an award?

Because he was outstanding in his field! ðŸŒ¾ðŸ˜„
```

- The bug is resolved.

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Fixed the issue of JSON output in chat by removing the JSON-enforcing prompt in `mcp_client/base.py`. The AI now responds in plain text. Verified working.
**Root Cause:** System prompt forced AI to output JSON.
