# MCP Client Project Overview

## 1. Objectives

Develop a versatile, user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) and REST API client to interact seamlessly with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The client aims to:

- Enable querying and managing multiple MCP-compatible servers.
- Facilitate integration of various Large Language Model (LLM) providers.
- Support multi-server collaboration for complex queries.
- Provide an extensible, configurable platform for AI-driven workflows.

## 2. Scope

The project encompasses:

- **MCP Server Compatibility:** Out-of-the-box support for SQLite and Brave Search, with easy addition of new servers via configuration.
- **Multi-Provider LLM Support:** Integration with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, AWS Nova, Groq, Ollama, and others through LangChain.
- **Interfaces:**
  - **CLI:** For direct command-line interactions.
  - **REST API:** Built with FastAPI, enabling programmatic access.
- **Configuration:** API keys, providers, and models configurable via environment variables or JSON config.
- **Sample Data:** Includes a SQLite database (`test.db`) with example data.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to add new MCP servers and LLM providers with minimal effort.

## 3. Methodology

- **Architecture:**
  - Modular Python package (`mcp_client`) with clear separation of CLI, API, and core logic.
  - Utilizes LangChain for LLM abstraction and orchestration.
  - Async support via FastAPI and `aiosqlite` for scalable API interactions.
- **Technologies:**
  - **Python 3.12+**
  - **LangChain ecosystem** for multi-LLM support.
  - **FastAPI** for REST API.
  - **Uvicorn** as ASGI server.
  - **SQLite** for local data storage.
  - **JSON Schema** for validation.
- **Development Workflow:**
  - Environment setup via `pyproject.toml`.
  - API keys managed through environment variables or config files.
  - CLI commands executed via `uv run cli.py`.
  - REST API served via `uvicorn app:app --reload`.
  - Testing with sample prompts and curl commands.
- **Extensibility Approach:**
  - New MCP servers added by updating `mcp-server-config.json`.
  - New LLM providers integrated via LangChain modules.

## 4. Key Milestones

- **Initial Setup:**
  - Project scaffolding with CLI and REST API.
  - Integration with SQLite and Brave Search MCP servers.
- **LLM Integration:**
  - Support for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, AWS Nova, Groq, Ollama.
- **LangChain Integration:**
  - Enable multi-LLM orchestration and prompt execution.
- **Configuration Management:**
  - Environment variables and JSON config support.
- **Sample Data & Prompts:**
  - Provide example database and queries.
- **Documentation:**
  - README with setup and usage instructions.
- **Next Milestones:**
  - Enhanced error handling and logging.
  - UI dashboard (optional future scope).
  - Automated testing suite.
  - Packaging for PyPI distribution.
  - Community contributions and plugin ecosystem.

## 5. Analysis & Insights

- **Strengths:**
  - Highly modular and extensible design.
  - Broad LLM provider compatibility via LangChain.
  - Dual interface (CLI + REST API) increases usability.
  - Simple configuration and setup.
- **Challenges:**
  - Managing API key security across multiple providers.
  - Ensuring consistent behavior across diverse MCP servers.
  - Handling rate limits and errors gracefully.
- **Opportunities:**
  - Adding a web UI for easier management.
  - Expanding supported MCP servers.
  - Incorporating advanced orchestration features.
  - Building a plugin system for custom workflows.

## 6. Actionable Recommendations

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Implement secure storage for API keys.
  - Add authentication and authorization to REST API.
- **Robustness:**
  - Improve error handling and user feedback.
  - Add automated tests for CLI and API endpoints.
- **Documentation:**
  - Expand usage examples and developer guides.
  - Document process for adding new MCP servers and LLM providers.
- **Feature Expansion:**
  - Develop a web-based dashboard.
  - Support additional data sources and search providers.
  - Enable more complex multi-agent workflows.
- **Community Building:**
  - Encourage open-source contributions.
  - Create tutorials and showcase projects.
